# The Mechanics Project repo

This repo contains small scale group collaboration projects from members of the Mechanics peer learning group during (and hopefully after) their time in the ALX Software Engineering program

These projects are a means to develop as software engineers by giving us
- practical experience in unsupervised project building
- opportunities to understand and/or practice concepts, techniques and technologies better by applying them to hobby projects
