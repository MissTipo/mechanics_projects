## Roadmap

### Front-end Team
Lead(s) - Nat and Victor

#### To Do

- [ ] Decide on a framework

- [ ] Create the game board and the game pieces

- [ ] Implement the game logic and user interaction using JavaScript
    - [ ]  Write the JavaScript code for the game logic, including functions for checking the winner, detecting invalid moves, and updating the game state.
    - [ ]  Write the JavaScript code for user interaction, such as clicking on a game piece, highlighting the available moves, and displaying the winner).

- [ ]  Decide on communication protocol to integrate the front-end with the back-end (REST APIs or WebSockets)
- [ ]  Write the JavaScript code to make HTTP requests to the back-end APIs or establish a WebSocket connection.
- [ ]  Handle the responses from the back-end and update the game state accordingly.
        

#### Others

- [ ]  Create a login and authentication system for users.
Add sound effects or animations to the game.
- [ ]  Implement a timer or countdown for each move.
- [ ]  Write unit tests for the front-end code to ensure its correctness.
- [ ]  Optimize the performance of the front-end code by using lazy loading or code splitting.

### Back-end Team
Lead(s) ?  

#### To Do
- [ ]  Decide on a library (preferrably Express)
- [ ]  Define the data models for the game
    - [ ]  Define the data structure for storing game information, such as the game board, game state, and player information.
    - [ ]  Decide on a database system (MongoDB or PostgreSQL).
    - [ ]  Define the database schema and write the necessary database queries to interact with the database.
- [ ]  Implement the game logic using Node.js or any other chosen back-end technology
    - [ ]  Write the JavaScript code for the game logic, including functions for checking the winner, detecting invalid moves, and updating the game state.
    - [ ]  Write the JavaScript code for handling game events, such as starting a new game, making a move, and ending the game.
    - [ ]  Use a back-end framework or library to handle HTTP requests and responses.
- [ ]  Create APIs for the front-end team to interact with the back-end
    - [ ]  Define the API endpoints for starting a new game, making a move, and getting the game state.
    - [ ]  Write the JavaScript code to handle the API requests and responses.
    - [ ]  Use middleware to handle authentication and authorization of users.
- [ ]  Write unit tests and integration tests for the back-end code to ensure its correctness
    - [ ]  Write unit tests to test individual functions and modules.
    - [ ]  Write integration tests to test the API endpoints and their interactions with the database.
    - [ ]  Use a testing framework, such as Jest or Mocha, to run the tests.
- [ ] Optimize the performance and scalability of the back-end code
    - [ ] Use caching to reduce the number of database queries and improve performance.
    - [ ] Use load balancing and clustering to handle a large number of concurrent requests.
    - [ ] Use a monitoring tool, such as New Relic or Datadog, to monitor the performance of the back-end.

#### Others
- [ ]  Create a logging system to record errors and debug information.
- [ ]  Implement a rate limiting system to prevent spamming or abuse of the APIs.
- [ ]  Use encryption and hashing to secure sensitive data, such as passwords.
- [ ]  Write documentation for the APIs and the back-end code.
